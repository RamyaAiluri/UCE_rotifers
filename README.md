# 🧬 Identifying UCEs for Stepwise Phylogenetic Analysis of Gnesiotrocha and Ploima Rotifers

## 📖 Overview
Rotifers play a vital ecological role in freshwater systems, yet their phylogenetic relationships remain largely unresolved due to the limitations of traditional genetic markers such as **18S RNA and COI**. This study leverages the power of **Ultra-Conserved Elements (UCEs)** to provide a more refined understanding of rotifer evolution.

## 🔬 Research Approach
We employed a **stepwise approach** to UCE identification, analyzing the **entire rotifer group (15 species)** before conducting **subgroup-specific investigations** on:
- **Gnesiotrocha (3 species)** – One of the most morphologically diverse rotifer groups.
- **Ploima (12 species)** – A diverse group critical to ecosystem functioning.

By performing **separate analyses** on these subgroups, we aimed to uncover **conserved loci** that may have been overlooked in broader analyses.

## 🧪 Methodology
- **Software Used:** Phyluce software package
- **UCE Identification:**
  - 2,323 **conserved loci** and 10,134 **probes** across all rotifers
  - 2,230 **loci** identified in **Gnesiotrocha**
  - 199 **loci** identified in **Ploima**

## 🔍 Key Findings
- **Enhanced phylogenetic resolution** achieved through subgroup-specific UCE analysis.
- **More precise evolutionary insights** by targeting specific rotifer groups.
- **Demonstrated the effectiveness** of subgroup-based UCE studies for resolving complex phylogenies.

## 📌 Conclusion
Our findings underscore the importance of **subgroup-specific UCE analysis** to capture the complexity of rotifer evolution. This approach provides a **valuable framework** for future studies on other invertebrate lineages, enhancing phylogenetic resolution where traditional markers fall short.
